# DiPhyx Case Studies Repository

Welcome to the official **DiPhyx Case Studies** repository. This repository hosts real-world computational pipelines and example workflows designed to demonstrate how DiPhyx can power complex, compute-intensive scientific models. These examples span various disciplines, with a current focus on **Bioinformatics, Genomics, and Biotech** use cases.

## About DiPhyx
[DiPhyx](https://diphyx.com) is a unified cloud platform built to simplify and accelerate scientific computing. It enables researchers, engineers, and data scientists to design, run, monitor, and productionize scientific workflows effortlessly. Unlike general-purpose cloud tools, DiPhyx is purpose-built for scientific computing and includes built-in tools for job tracking, reproducibility, optimization, and visualization.

Whether you are a seasoned DiPhyx user or just exploring advanced scientific computing tools, this repository provides valuable examples you can adapt, extend, and learn from.

## Getting Started

### Using Case Studies on DiPhyx
If you're a DiPhyx user:
1. Launch your desired compute-unit via [DiPhyx Dashboard](https://diphyx.com/dashboard)
2. Choose the `flow` from the `New Project` list.
3. Use the data and scripts provided in the case study to run your analysis.

### Running Locally or on Other Platforms
While DiPhyx provides native support and enhanced features, most of the case studies can also be run locally or on other cloud environments with minimal setup.

Make sure you have the required dependencies installed. Each case study lists the needed packages or containers.
